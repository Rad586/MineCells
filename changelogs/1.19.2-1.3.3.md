# Mine Cells 1.3.3

## IMPORTANT

- Mine Cells should display a message when you open a world where you had a previous version installed. If it doesn't, [here's a guide on what you should do](https://github.com/mim1q/MineCells/wiki/Updating-Mine-Cells)

## Mechanics

- Added new **Conjunctivius Spawn Obelisk**! It enables players to respawn the boss after it has been defeated.

## Items

- **Guts** and **Monster's Eye** - two new items that drop from Mine Cells' mobs. Can be eaten or used as crafting ingredients.
- **Blank Rune** and **Conjunctivius Respawn Rune** - required to activate the Conjunctivius Spawn Obelisk

## Compatibility

- Added a lot of custom compatibility with other mods: Supplementaries, Bewitchment, Create. Thank you to **SoullessGirl2000** on my Discord for creating the files! :)
- Fixed a bug with First Person Model mod, where the player model was rotated incorrectly when riding an elevator

## Language

- Created Polish translation
- Replaced hard-coded damage, cooldown, etc. in lang entries with `%s`

## Bugfixes

- Portal activation sound re-added
- Wall and Hanging Leaves can now only be placed on solid surfaces and leaves
