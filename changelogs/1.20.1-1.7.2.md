# Mine Cells 1.7.2

## Guidebook

There is now a custom Mine Cells Guidebook item! [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) is needed for the book
to work, but isn't a required dependency (so, if you don't have Patchouli, the mod will still work, you just won't get the Guidebook!)

- The Guidebook is granted when you first find a Doorway to the Prisoners' Quarters
- Alternatively, it can be crafted with a Book and Prison Bricks

## Blocks

- Small crates can now be rotated based on the player's rotation
- Added 3 new poses to the King Statue. These can be cycled through by right-clicking the block.

## Mobs

- Added "jump back" mechanics to Undead Archers, Grenadiers and Sweepers
- If the player gets too close to these mobs, they will back off to a safer distance

## Bug fixes

- Further prevention of desync issues with Rifts and Doorways, thanks to a new config option 
- Fixed the Ramparts structure sometimes generating into itself
