The **Blood Sword** and **Hattori's Katana** are found in loot in the Prison dungeon.  
**Cursed Sword** and **Conjunctivius's Tentacle** drop from the Conjunctivius boss.

## Fixes

- The game should no longer crash if a portal cannot find the world data regarding
  its overworld destination. Instead, it will now teleport the player to the world spawn.
