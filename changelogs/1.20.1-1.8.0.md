## Weapons

### 13 New Ranged Weapons!

Bows and crossbows - work similar to vanilla bows and crossbows, but each one has a unique twist!  
There is one difference from vanilla - all the Bows can only be fired when fully charged!

| **Ice Bow**                | Applies the *Frozen* effect to the target                                                        | Ice Arrow      |
| **Nerves of Steel**        | Deals critical damage if you release the arrow at the right moment, right after you hear a sound | Arrow          |

Electric weapons - multiple-use weapons that make use of the *Electrified* effect

| Name               | Description                                                                                                                               |

| Firebrands     | Lights the target block or entity on fire               |

### 6 new custom Shields!

These work differently from vanilla shields. They block only part of the damage if you hold them up. They will only
block 100% of the damage if you time the parry correctly. If you do, you will also damage the attacker and trigger a 
special parry effect!

| Name                    | Block effect                                  | Parry effect                                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Cudgel**              | Stuns the attacker for a fraction of a second | The stun lasts longer                               |
| **Rampart**             | -                                             | Makes you invulnerable for a short time             |
| **Assault Shield**      | Makes you lunge forward when used             | Resets the cooldown of the lunge ability            |
| **Bloodthirsty Shield** | -                                             | Applies the *Bleeding* effect to enemies around you |
| **Greed shield**        | -                                             | Has a chance to drop a valuable item when you parry |
| **Ice Shield**          | Slows down the attacker                       | Applies the *Frozen* effect to the attacker         |

### Crit indicator

- If a weapon is going to inflict a critical hit, a little red sword icon will appear next to your crosshair.

### Conjunctivius' Tentacle improvements

- The weapon now highlights the block / entity you will latch onto
- You can only use the Tentacle if a block or entity is highlighted
- Improved the overall feel of the weapon, tweaked the pulling mechanics
- The weapon does a bit less damage by default, but does critical hits when you're getting pulled
- Increased base range to 24 blocks (now configurable!)
- Added a Better Combat animation
- Added fall protection to help you with some awkward maneuvers

## Mob drops

TODO

## Conjunctivius

- Improved the dash attack by making it more *explosive* visually :)
- Added a few new attack variants and tweaked the existing ones
- Conjunctivius will now look at her target instead of always at the camera
- Reduced weird Conjunctivius Projectile position jitter

## Screenshake

- Some events now have a screenshake effect! These include the more powerful boss attack and the flint special ability.
- The screenshake is configurable in the `minecells-client.json5` file, as well as the Accessibility menu.

## Config

### Client `minecells-client.json5`

- Screenshake config, mentioned above, separate for each event

### Server `minecells-common.json5`

- Added the ability to disable the fall protection mechanic of the Ramparts dimension
- Added max Conjunctivius' Tentacle distance config (breaks with extra large values :c)

## Compatibility & bugfixes

- Added a workaround for the notorious Sparse Structures mod incompatibility (custom config no longer required!)
- Removed left-clicking Obelisks activating them, possibly preventing some issues with non-standard attack implementations


## Technical

Mine Cells now uses my new modding library, [Gimm1q](https://github.com/mim1q/gimm1q)! There's no need to download
it separately, it's bundled with the mod.
