# Mine Cells 1.8.0

## Weapons

### Conjunctivius' Tentacle improvements

- The weapon now highlights the block / entity you will latch onto
- You can only use the Tentacle if a block or entity is highlighted
- Improved the overall feel of the weapon, tweaked the pulling mechanics
- The weapon does a bit less damage by default, but does critical hits when you're getting pulled
- Added a Better Combat animation

### 9 New Ranged Bows & Crossbows!

- TODO

## Conjunctivius

- Improved the dash attack by making it more *explosive* visually :)
- Added a few new attack variants and tweaked the existing ones
- Conjunctivius will now look at her target instead of always at the camera
- Reduced weird Conjunctivius Projectile position jitter

## Screenshake

- Some events now have a screenshake effect! These include the more powerful boss attack and the flint special ability.
- The screenshake is configurable in the `minecells-client.json5` file

## Config

### Client `minecells-client.json5`

- Screenshake config, mentioned above, separate for each event

### Server `minecells-common.json5`

- Added the ability to disable the fall protection mechanic of the Ramparts dimension
- Added max Conjunctivius' Tentacle distance config (breaks with extra large values :c)
