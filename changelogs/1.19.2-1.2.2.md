# Mine Cells - Dead Cells Mod 1.2.2 beta

## Blocks

- Added 3 new (creative-only) decorative blocks: **Alchemical Vials**, **Spilled Alchemical** **Vials and Alchemical Equipment**.
- Cell Forge's "Cell Liquid" texture is now slightly animated.

## Bugfixes and improvements

- Fixed incompatibility with **It Takes a Pillage** mod. (And possibly other mods that adjust the Milk Bucket's functionality)
- Players who die in the Prison dimension now respawn there, in the portal they came from.
- Quality of life changes for the **Cell Forge**:  
  You can now shift-click items into their corresponding slots in the crafting inventory.  
  The items come back into your inventory when you select another recipe.  
  Selecting a recipe plays the "button press" sound effect.
