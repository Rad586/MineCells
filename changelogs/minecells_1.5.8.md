# Mine Cells 1.5.8

- You can now walk through vertical Big Chains
- Removed some unused code that could cause lag
- Optimized a few functions
- Fixed crash with Fabric Loader 0.15.x

## Spawner Rune technical overhaul

- Spawner runes will now spawn as block entities. You are able to place blocks
  "on top of them", which will turn them into entities. No more 2000+ spawner
  rune entities in the world!
