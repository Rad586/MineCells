# Mine Cells 1.6.0 - Huge Update!

## **IMPORTANT**

- Make sure to reset the dimensions of Mine Cells! Follow the guide [here](https://mim1q.dev/minecells/updating/)
- This version has been tested by myself but there may be unknown game-breaking bugs!  
  Proceed with caution and please report any bugs and crashes you see either on Github or through my Discord.

## New Dimensions

### Ramparts

- accessed from the Promenade of the Condemned
- is a long segmented wall, with platforms and towers around it
- has 3 new unique enemies
- leads to the Black Bridge, through the last tower with a purple stripe
- Has a unique new mechanic: If you fall from the Ramparts,
  **you will be teleported back up** and take a few hearts of damage.

### Black Bridge

- accessed from the Ramparts
- contains the new boss, The Concierge

## The Concierge - New Boss

### Attacks

- leaps towards the player, dealing damage on impact ( only happens after phase 1 )
- sends out a large circular shockwave around himself
- punches the player, dealing damage and knocking them back
- generates a damaging aura around himself

These attacks get more powerful and faster as the fight progresses.

### Drops

- 32 diamonds / emeralds / iron ingots
- The Flint

## New Items

### Weapons

- **The Flint** - hold Right Click to charge a shockwave attack, dealing 16HP to enemies in front of you
- **Spite Sword** - deals additional damage if you've been hit recently

### Doorways

- All Mine Cells dimensions now have a doorway item (obtained when breaking the blocks, not craftable)

### Dimensional Runes

- Can be used on a doorway in the Overworld to change it to a different dimension
- Can only be used if you have visited the dimension before in the doorway's bound area

### Concierge Respawn Rune

- Respawns the Concierge when used on the Concierge Respawn Obelisk

## Blocks

### Cracked Prison Bricks variants

- full block, stairs, slabs and walls

### Flags

The flags are now implemented in a different way, so each one of them is a different block type.  
Your existing flags might disappear because of this!

- Added 4 new flags:
    - **Ramparts Flag** - found in the Ramparts
    - **Red Ribbon Flag** - found in the Ramparts
    - **Large Red Ribbon Flag** - found in the Ramparts
    - **Black Bridge Flag** - found in the Black Bridge
- Flags can now be placed horizontally
    - To do so, place it on the side of a fence
- Added support for large flags
    - Currently only the Large Red Ribbon uses this fact, but more will be added in the future

### Rift

- A portal that can take you back to the Overworld,
- usually spawning at the beginning of a non-boss dimension or at the end of a boss dimension

### Other

- added Ramparts Torch
- you can now walk through Big Chains

## Mobs

### Inquisitor

- previously available in creative, now spawns in the Ramparts
- shoots a magic projectile that travels through walls

### Sweeper

- sweeps the ground, sending a flaming shockwave towards the player

### Buzzcutter

- flies around, bites the player if they get too close

## Structures

- Removed one floor from the Prisoners' Quarters to make it less tedious
- Made underground structures in the Promenade twice as common
- Added a new Wall structure to the Promenade's perimeter
- Added a Tower structure next to Promenade's spawn that leads to the Ramparts

## Bug fixes and optimization

- Fixed crash with Fabric Loader 0.15.x
- Removed some unused code that could cause lag
- Spawner runes will now spawn as block entities.   
  You are able to place blocks "on top of them", which will turn them into entities.  
  No more 2000+ spawner rune entities in the world!
- Fixed a few missing / incorrect crafting recipes

## Visual

- added a custom background texture to the Creative Tab
- added custom textures for mob Spawn Eggs
- tweaked a few textures
- tweaked Big Chain models
- Doorways will now display their bound coordinates when hovered over

## Other

- Added Advancements for the new dimensions and boss
- Tweaked a few loot tables and weapon / mob attributes
- You can now sleep in beds in Mine Cells dimensions
- Might have missed some things because of the scope of the update :P
