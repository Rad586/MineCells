  Proceed with caution and please report any bugs and crashes you see either on Github or through my Discord.

## Portal overhaul

- Removed old circular dimension portals
- They have been replaced with Doorways that can be broken, crafted and placed elsewhere (only in the Overworld)
- A tooltip is shown that tells you if you have already visited the Prisoners' Quarters in the area you're in.
- If you break a doorway, it will remember the area it was placed in.
- Added new Teleporters that look similar to the old portals **(Not available without cheats yet!)**

## Blocks
