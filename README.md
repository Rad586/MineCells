<details>
    <summary>Forge? Port to old version?</summary>

No, **I will not make mods for Forge**. I am fully commited to being a Fabric mod developer.
If you wish to play my mods on Forge, you should check out [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector),
which should work nearly flawlessly in survival.
I probably won't port any of my mods to outdated Minecraft versions, either.

<details>
    <summary>I got lost in one of Mine Cells's dimensions, what can I do?</summary>

Use a compass to guide you back to the entrance. Compasses sometimes spawn in chests in the Promenade.

<details>
    <summary>Can I use this mod in my modpack / showcase video?</summary>

You can use this mod in your modpacks and videos! Asking for consent beforehand is appreciated, but not necessary.
I would be grateful if you sent me the video link so I can check it out!
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Will you add ... to this mod?</summary>

This mod aims to add most of the content from Dead Cells (except the Castlevania DLC) to Minecraft. If it is present in
Dead
Cells, it'll probably be added to this mod, sooner or later. Some unique tweaks and additions were made in order to make
the
content work in the environment of Minecraft without straying too far from the source material.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Is this mod compatible with ...?</summary>

This mod should be compatible with most other mods. There might be some bugs that make it crash when other mods are
present, but I'm trying to remove them as soon as they're known. If you encounter such a bug make sure
to [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/mim1q/MineCells/issues) or ask for help on the Discord server linked
above!
